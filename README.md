# BBB-Ada-Intro
Some basic mucking around on the BeagleBone Black using Ada

The purpose for this is to eventually provide some basic examples
of how to interface with the hardware on the BBB.  In some ways
this will be a record of my explorations.  Eventually, once this
gets figured out it will get packaged up into a nice set of
Ada packages, but that will be another repository.

Then on to doing it all again in Lispâ€¦

## Addendum
It's been a few years since I've done anything on this and looking back
is a bit interesting.  Since then, thing have been packaged up and runs
on BeagleBone Black, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Due.  The Lisp comment is
interesting since I now have a working tiny-Lisp interpreter written in
Ada that can interface with the Analog inputs and digital pins on the
Arduino Due.
